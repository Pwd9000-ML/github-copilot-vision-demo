# 1 - Create secured web app in Azure + Identity + Access to SQL via Managed Identity (M) 7 min

@azure wire an Az CLI script to create a web app in Azure with a Managed Identity and access to an Azure SQL Server. The web app should be hosted in a Resource Group named "github-copilot-web-apps". The SQL Server should be hosted in the same Resource Group. The script should also assign the web app's Managed Identity as an AAD/ENTRAID Admin for the SQL Server. I want the script to do these things:
"Write a PowerShell script to automate the deployment of a web app in Azure using Azure CLI. The script should:
- Log in to Azure: Include a placeholder for the login command (comment it out for now).

- Declare Variables: Create variables for the following resource configurations:
    ResourceGroupName: "github-copilot-web-apps-demo"
    DemoNumber: "23577"
    Location: "uksouth"
    JsonContainerName: "webapp-resources-json"
    StorageAccountName: "webappdemo23577"
    AppServicePlanName: "webappdemo-plan-23577"
    WebAppName: "pwd900webappdemo23577"
    SqlServerName: "webappdemosqlserver23577"
    SqlDatabaseName: "webappdemo-db23577"

- Create the Azure Resources as pr the variables using Azure CLI commands:
    Create a Resource Group in the specified location.
    Create a Blob Storage Account in the Resource Group.
    Retrieve the storage account key and use it to create a blob container named "webapp-resources-json".
    
-Deploy an App Service Plan and Web App:
    Create an App Service Plan named AppServicePlanName.
    
-Deploy a Web App with the following:
    Runtime: "NODE:20-lts"
    Plan: AppServicePlanName
    Managed Identity enabled.

- Configure SQL Server and Database:
    Retrieve the System Managed Identity for the Web App.
    Create a SQL Server with Entra ID-only authentication.
    Set the Web App's Managed Identity as the SQL Server admin.
    Create a SQL Database named SqlDatabaseName.
    Add a firewall rule to allow access for Azure services.

- Deploy Web App Code:
    Deploy the web app from a zipped file located at .\demo\myapp1.zip.
    Enable build during deployment

Additional Notes:
Ensure all commands are idempotent (can run multiple times without causing errors).
Include comments to explain each step of the script."

@azure /resources Does the web app hosted in Resource Group "github-copilot-web-apps" have an Identity assigned?
@azure /resources What is the Principal ID for the Identity assigned to the web app hosted in Resource Group "github-copilot-web-apps"?
@azure /resources Does the Identity assigned to the web app hosted in Resource Group "github-copilot-web-apps" have any sort of access anywhere?
@azure /resources What about the SQL Server in Resource Group "github-copilot-web-apps"? Who is the AAD/ENTRAID Admin?
